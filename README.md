# What I learned

This project was my first big step into implementing javascript with HTML and CSS. This page uses both buttons and forms, which requied some understanding of how javascript queries the various elements on the html document and assigns them values. After working with the basics of both html and javascript on their own, watching them work together here was exciting.

As far as the code goes, I tried to reduce as much as I could into functions since there is a lot of redundancy with the types of characters. Also, this project helped get me better-aquainted with boolean values and their proper shorthand usage in places like while loops. 

I needed to use character arrays for the different types of character families, but instead of writing my own arrays, I found how javascript uses the fromCharCode() method to retrieve characters from the ascii table. 

The final function of the project is a shuffling array designed to give the password a sense of randomness. This ended up being the most difficult piece of the project because it needed to copy elements and swap positions of two array. I was determined to get this piece in because it pushed my limits of my logical javascript capabilities.
